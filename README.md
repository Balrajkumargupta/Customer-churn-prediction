ðŸš€ Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸ“Š
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest machine learning project where I built a Customer Churn Prediction Model using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting! ðŸŒŸ
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic and service-related factors.
ðŸ“Œ Dataset:
Used the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which contains details like contract type, payment method, tenure, and monthly charges.
ðŸ“Œ Steps Followed:
âœ… Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature encoding)
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ… Feature Engineering & Selection
âœ… Training ML Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
âœ… Model Evaluation (Classification Report, ROC Curve, Performance Comparison)
âœ… Insights & Interpretability
ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways:
ðŸ“Š Feature Importance: Contract type and monthly charges had a strong influence on churn.
ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance: Gradient Boosting performed best with higher accuracy and AUC score.
ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact: The model helps identify high-risk customers, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.
ðŸ”Ž Next Steps:
ðŸ“Œ Experimenting with XGBoost & SHAP for better model interpretability
ðŸ“Œ Deploying the best model as an API
